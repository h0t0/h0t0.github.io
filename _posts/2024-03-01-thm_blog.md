# Tryhackme Blog Writeup

Hello Again :)

## **Reconnaissance and Enumeration**

as usual, we start with scanning the machine 
#### **nmap scan**

![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-1.png)

 we have 4 ports open, ssh, http, and samba, its a good practice to check ftp, samba or nfs before going to the web server.

#### **samba enumeration**

i will use `smbclient -L [IP HERE]` to check for avilable shares.

![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-2.png)

 found BillySMB, we connect to the share.

 ![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-3.png)
 
 found three files, we can extract them by using `get FILE_NAME`.
lets check them!

if you scan it you will go to this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFTLKWw542g :)

nothing important

tswift.mp4 

also nothing important

#### **web enumeration**

now lets check the webpage

the page is struggling to load which is wierd, as in the description  “you'll need to add blog.thm to your /etc/hosts file”

 ![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-6.png)

the flag -a in tee means you append what you pipe into it, without it the file will be wiped.

we find a blog (obviously), its powerd by wordpress.

 ![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-7.png)

since its powered with wordpress and we can access the admin panel, i will use wpscan to scan for usernames.

the command: 
```bash
wpscan --url http://blog.thm/ --enumerate u
```
 ![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-8.png)

the wordpress version is 5.0, we could use this later or search for a cve.
we found two users: kwheel and bjoel, now its time to get the passwords, i will create a file named “users.txt” with the usernames in it.

the command: 
```bash
wpscan -U users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --url http://blog.thm
```
success!!! we found the password for kwheel

we try the creditinals to access the amdin panel and bingo we're in!

## **Initial Access:**

#### **CVE-2019-8943**
now lets search for a cve.
we know from the wp scan the wp version is 5.0.

we find in exploit db CVE-2019-8943 named Crop-image Shell Upload,
which is already has a script for it in metasploit framework!

to access metasploit just type in the terminal:
```bash
msfconsole
```
we edit the options, type exploit, and we are in!!!

to find the user flag i will use the command :
```bash
find / 2>/dev/null | grep user.txt
```

well it's not the right file.

## **Privilege Escalation:**

instead of looking for the user flag lets look for a way to escelate our privligies.
i used this command to search for binary SUID's.
```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```
 ![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-14.png)

alot of these are common, but /usr/sbin/checker is not, lets check it out.

 ![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-15.png)

the binary checkes whether the user is admin or not.

 ![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-16.png)

to check how this tools works, i will use `ltrace` which captures any library calls and prints it out for us!
it seems checkes if the user is admin or not by reading an enviornment variable named "admin".

 ![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-17.png)

so we can exploit this if we set an enviornment variable , export admin=1

 ![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-18.png)

#### **root.txt**

succes we are root!

 ![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-19.png)

#### **finding user.txt**

we go back to find the user flag, so we search for it again since we own the machine now.

![image](/assets/img/blog-thm/1-20.png)

now the machine is pwned.

happy pwning :)
