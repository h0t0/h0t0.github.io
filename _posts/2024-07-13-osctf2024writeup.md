## Style Query Listing...?

Web

pfft.. Listen, I've gained access to this login portal but I'm not able to log in. The admins are surely hiding something from the public, but... I don't understand what. Here take the link and be quiet, don't share it with anyone

we are presented with a login page, if you try to login with default credentials nothing will work, so as the name suggests its SQL injection.

![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713184020.png>)

the first payload i tried is `admin' or true-- -`
![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713184058.png>)

and we get an exception from the Werkzug server, the good thing about these messages is that it shows 5 lines above and bottom of the line that got the error.

![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713184219.png>)

```python
if username == 'admin':
	return redirect(url_for('admin'))
```

so if the user is admin in the input it will redirect the user to the admin page, which is /admin.

if we go to `http://34.16.207.52:3635/admin` we will find the flag!!!

## Indoor WebApp

Web

The production of this application has been completely indoor so that no corona virus spreads, but that's an old talk right?

Author: @5h1kh4r

`Web Instance: http://34.16.207.52:2546`

We see the Vulnerability name in the main page, with a button to view a profile.

![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713184705.png>)

the button will take us to `http://34.16.207.52:2546/profile?user_id=1`
we see a username and an email.
but in the link the query parameter `?user_id=1` indicates that we can change the number to view other profiles, for sanity check i like to try 2.

![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713184930.png>)

and we got the flag!!!

## Action Notes

Web

I have created this notes taking app so that I don't forget what I've studied

Author: @5h1kh4r

`Web Instance: http://34.16.207.52:8965`

In the main page we can either login or register, so i register an account and login with it.

![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713185204.png>)

We can add notes to our profile, but i first looked to the cookies.
![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713185254.png>)


`session:eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRlc3QyMTMifQ.ZpKirg.NeEcUdx51_beLfIjFVIdC60Jqj8`

the session cookie looks like a JWT but if you try to decode it with [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)
you will get an error.

but we know this is a flask server because if you go to /console you will get:
![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713185530.png>)

in [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/flask) we can see there is a tool called `flask-unsign`, if we put the cookie in it and try to decode it we will get:
```bash
flask-unsign --decode --cookie "eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRlc3QyMTMifQ.ZpKirg.NeEcUdx51_beLfIjFVIdC60Jqj8"`
```

![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713185817.png>)

using the tool we can try to crack the secret code using the same tool with this command:

```bash
flask-unsign --unsign --cookie "eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRlc3QyMTMifQ.ZpKirg.NeEcUdx51_beLfIjFVIdC60Jqj8"
```

and we got the secret key!!!

![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713185944.png>)
Secret Key: `supersecretkey`

so know we can sign our own cookies and change the username to admin.

```bash
flask-unsign --sign --cookie "{'username': 'admin'}" --secret 'supersecretkey'
```

![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713190122.png>)

and we got our new cookie, if we change it with the new one in our browser, we will see some players trolling, but if we go to /admin we will find the flag.

![alt text](</assets/img/osctf/Pasted image 20240713190256.png>)

We got the flag!!!
